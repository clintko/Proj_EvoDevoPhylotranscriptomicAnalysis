# Project: Study Evo Devo using Phylotranscriptomic Analysis

This is my Master thesis project. The title of my thesis is "Phylotranscriptomic patterns of network stochasticity and pathway dynamics during embryogenesis". During my master study, I joined a system biology lab, in which I worked on a project measuring network stochasticity and sketching out the involved pathway dynamics by analyzing protein-protein association network and gene expression data. The study, providing an alternative aspect of comparative embryology, was presented at the 88th annual meeting of Genetics Society of Japan (GSJ) in 2016.
